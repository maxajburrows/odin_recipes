    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Need a quick healthy meal? This is hands-down one of the tastiest <strong><em>Tofu sandwiches</em></strong> I’ve ever had! 
       I keep thinking if we still had our restaurant this would for sure be on the menu this week! 
       It’s a fast easy meal, and oh so satisfying!</p>

    </ol>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Tofu</li>
        <li>Olive oil or coconut oil</li>
        <li>BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>Sriracha or red chili paste</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>Vegan Mayo</li>
        <li>AC vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Soft, toasted buns</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut the tofu into two slabs, one-inch thick, perhaps trimming to fit the bun. Pat gently with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Season a skillet generously with oil, salt and fresh cracked pepper and heat it up.</li>
        <li>Sear the tofu on both sides, until deeply golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>While the tofu is cooking, make the quick and easy slaw, using precut cabbage if pressed for time. Cilantro and onion add great flavor here.</li>
        <li>Mix BBQ Sauce and red chili paste (or sriracha) in a bowl and brush it liberally on the tofu, getting the bottom too. Let the sauce caramelize 
            just slightly in the pan, before turning the heat off.</li>
        <li>Toast the buns and assemble! Feel free to add avocado if you like- a bit messier, but oh so tasty! And voila! You’ll have a delicious meal on the 
            table in under 30 minutes! This recipe makes two hearty sandwiches.</li>
    </ol>
